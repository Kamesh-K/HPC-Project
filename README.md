# Monte Carlo Simulation for Option Pricing 
## Overview
In this particular project, I worked mainly on the applications of high performance computing in finance. One of the methods of predicting price of options is by simulating the market using Monte-Carlo Simulations. Due to the nature of Monte-Carlo simulations, we can parallelize the total number of simulations across the available processors. The results are reported for both the single core and multi-core performace of the implementation.
